Welcome to Momentum Unity. After a few days of development, hopefully it would be worth the wait.

You can use this template to make your own fast-paced parkour FPS game, through you need to delete a few useless files (unless you want).

I made my whole project using our own super-duper permissive *license*, with some exceptions of course.

It was started somewhere around June 2023 using 2021.3.24f1 version, and then, for restoration reasons, upgraded to the most stable version, at the time of this repository.

# Momentum Unity

Momentum Unity is an parkour first-person prototype made with Unity as an practice project.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is no longer in development, thus no support will be provided.

## Features

- Source-like movement controller.
- Full body model with animations.
- Developer console useful for developers, modders, and players alike.
- Cheat codes, though there's not much to use.
- Surf section including the "impossible" surf.

## Building

1. Download and install [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download) and Unity [2022.3.22f1](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive).
2. Clone this by either copying the URL and type `git clone` with your copied url in your terminal, command prompt, etc. or clicking `Code` and `Download ZIP` if you're not comfortable with Git.
3. Run Unity Hub, click `Add`, navigate to the path you cloned, click `Open`, and then select `MomentumUnity`.
4. Once in Unity, click `File > Build & Run` or press the `Build & Run` shortcut (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> by default).
5. Select the directory you like and click `Select folder`.
6. Wait for build to finish.
7. Open the builded folder and run there.

> [!WARNING]
> For macOS, just drag your `.app` and drop into `Applications` folder before you could run.
> I don't have an Mac device so i have no idea when it changes, build at your own risk.
>
> If you rebuilded again, you need to delete that `.app` and do that again (unless you somehow already linked them).
>
> If you're using Linux, right click your executable file and click `Properties` or something similar, go to `Permissions` and tick `Allow file to run as a program` or, again, something similar.
>
> If you don't see that, just open your terminal and type `chmod +x MomentumUnity.x86_64`.

## Running

If you don't like building yourself using Unity editor or want to quickly test, you can test it by going to [the itch.io page](https://programneer.itch.io/momentumunity) to download there.
